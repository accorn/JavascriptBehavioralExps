# Various experiments
In the above folders, you will find a variety of behavioral experiments programmed in javascript using the jsPsych package and JATOS. These files are as is. As such, I cannot guarantee that they will work immeidately upon download. For each file downloaded, you will also need to add in the 'staticFiles' folder one level up. This file has all of the required javascript libraries. You will likely need to update the paths to properly reference this staticFiles folder.

Each of the files are commented to varying degrees, and the way they are programmed may differ as well. Some have an all in one html file that includes all of the neccessary code, and other will have a html file with separate .js file with the experiment code. Some of the files will run locally in a browser, but most will need to either be imported into jatos to run, or have all mentions of jatos in the code commented out.
