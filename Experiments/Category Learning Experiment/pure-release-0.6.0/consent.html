                    <h2>Title of Research Study:</h2>
                    <p>Human Decision Making</p>

                    <h2>Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?</h2>
                    <p>You are invited to participate in this study because you a registered member of the
                      online survey administration platform, speak English, and you
                      have indicated that you are 18 years of age or older.</p>

                    <h2>Why is this research being done?</h2>
                    <p>This study is designed to assess how people learn and make decisions and examine the factors which influence them.</p>

                    <h2>How long will the research last?</h2>
                    <p>It will take about approximately 45-60 minutes to complete this portion of study.</p>

                    <h2>What happens if I say “Yes, I want to be in this research”?</h2>
                    <p>If you decide to participate, please do the following:
                      <ul>
                      <li>	Finish reading the consent form and determine if you agree to participant.</li>
                      <li>	Click on the link to begin and follow the on screen instructions.</li>
                    </ul>
                      You will be asked to complete a series of brief demographic and personality questionnaires (1-5min) which will collect
                      non-identifiable information about you and your general personality characteristics.
                      This will be followed by a decision-making task (30-45min). In this task you will be asked to view lines on screen and make some decisions.
                      options over multiple trials.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What happens if I do not want to be in this research?</h2>
                    <p>Your participation in this study is voluntary. You can decide not to participate in
                      this research and it will not be held against you.  You can leave the study at any time.</p>

                    <h2>Is there any way being in this study could harm me?</h2>
                    <p>Some of the questionnaires may ask questions about alcohol, drug use, and potentially unethical behavior.
                      To protect your privacy, we would advise that you complete this
                      study in a private setting. If at any point you feel uncomfortable about the questions being asked, you
                      may exit the survey at any point. The decision-making tasks will have the same amount of discomfort as
                      perceived when sitting and looking at a computer screen for an extended period of time.</p>

                    <h2>What happens to the information collected for the research?</h2>
                    <p>All information will be kept on a password
                      protected computer and is only accessible by the research team.
                      The results of the research study may be published, and the data may be made publicly
                      available to the scientific community, but no one will be able to identify you.</p>
